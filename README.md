Linear regression is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm. This makes it a good choice for beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners alike.
Linear regression is a relatively fast and efficient algorithm. This means that it can be used to train and deploy models on large datasets.
Linear regression models are interpretable. This means that we can understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (house price) in our model. This can be useful for understanding the factors that drive house prices and identifying potential outliers.
